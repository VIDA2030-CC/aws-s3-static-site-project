# AWS S3 Static Website Project 🌐☁️

This was my **first beginner project** where I learned how to host a static website using Amazon S3.

## 🌟 What I Did:
- Created and configured an S3 bucket
- Uploaded an `index.html` and a zip file which i had to unzip
- Enabled static website hosting
- Made the site publicly accessible
- Repeated the process without help in under 3 minutes

## 📸 Screenshots:
Screenshots of my steps are included in the repository.

## 📚 What I Learned:
- Understanding AWS regions and how to choose the right one (I used `Ireland`)
- What S3 is and how it can host a website
- Basic AWS terminology: S3, Bucket, Region, Permissions, Static Hosting
